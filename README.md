Forage-TATA-Data-Visualisation

This virtual internship program focuses on using Excel, Power BI, and Microsoft PowerPoint for data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, and creating insights to address business questions.

Introduction:

An online retail store has hired you as a consultant to review their data and provide insights for the CEO and CMO. The business is performing well, and management wants to identify the main factors contributing to revenue to plan strategically for next year. They are interested in viewing metrics from both operations and marketing perspectives. Management also wants to expand the business and seeks guidance on areas that are performing well so they can focus on what works. They would like to see various metrics based on available demographic information.

Task 1: A meeting with the CEO and CMO is scheduled for next month, and you need to draft relevant analytics and insights to evaluate current business performance and suggest metrics for expansion decision-making. To prepare for the meeting, draft questions that you think will be important and relevant to both the CEO and the CMO. This preparation will guide you as you develop your presentation. For this task, you only need to draft the questions. Consider both quantitative and qualitative aspects. Create four questions that you think each business leader will ask and want to know the answers to. Ensure your questions are distinct, as the CEO and CMO view business decisions differently.

Task 2: In this task, you will create visuals based on four of the questions that the CEO and CMO have requested. You can use either Tableau or Power BI for this. Before starting the analysis, ensure that the data is properly cleaned. Create each visual on a separate tab, naming the tabs according to the question number. 

Question 1: The CEO is interested in a time series of revenue data for the year 2011. He wants to see detailed monthly revenue figures. The CEO is looking for seasonal trends and wants to understand why these trends occur. This analysis will help him forecast for next year.

Question 2: The CMO wants to view the top 10 countries generating the highest revenue. Additionally, he wants to see the quantity sold along with the revenue. The CMO does not want the United Kingdom included in this visual.

Question 3: The CMO wants information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is looking for a visual that shows the customer generating the most revenue at the top, gradually declining to the lower revenue customers. The CMO aims to target the high-revenue customers and ensure their satisfaction with the products.

Question 4: The CEO wants insights on product demand. He wants to analyze all countries and identify which regions have the highest demand for their products. Once he understands the regions with high demand, he will develop an expansion strategy targeting these areas to generate more business. He wants to see all data on a single view without scrolling or hovering over data points to identify demand. The United Kingdom does not need to be included, as the CEO is more interested in potential expansion opportunities.

Task 3: Create a script and record a video presenting your findings to the CEO and CMO based on the four questions they asked and the visuals you created in the previous tasks.
